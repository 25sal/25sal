	abstract = {Globalization, climate changes, innovative technologies and new human habits have increased atten- tion to water conservation and management. Therefore, behavioural studies became a key element to understand how and when water is used in residential environment. Water End USE Dataset and TOols (WEUSEDTO), an open water end use consumption dataset and data analytics tools, has been released to help researchers, water utilities and companies to test models and algorithms on real water consumption data. The dataset combines with some notebook python able to analyse high-resolution water data (data recorded with 1 sample per second) to provide several tools to manage raw data, compute statistical analysis, learn fixture usage and generate synthetic simulation models. In addition, washbasin flow data were used as a test case to illustrate the main features of WEUSEDTO: providing volume and duration of single events, classifying usages and simulating user’s behaviour.},

	abstract = {A smart micro-grid requires information technology to fast detect and control grid instabilities and to validate that processes will work as designed. But real power grid can not be used for testing and validation, so it is convenient to develop tools to simulate the real system. A relevant challenge in this field is the modeling of the grid, including sensors, control, communication network and computational components using software simulation. But the choice of the simulator depends on the research questions to be answered and possible existing simulation tools to combine with. In this paper we present a simulator we have designed and developed in the context of the CoSSMic project in order to test and control system behavior when anomalies are injected or initial conditions are modified and in order to analyze system performance and quality of service.},

For such applications, high security, resilience, and performance are non-negotiable. Therefore, in order to successfully host critical smart-grid applications and workloads, new cloud paradigms and mechanisms should be adopted to support greater security, resilience, and performance. In this direction, an initiative by the Second University of Naples aims at ensuring the critical requirements of data-intensity applications in a highly distributed cloud federated environment, in which smart-grid applications represent a relevant case study.},

Within this scenario, ICT solutions will help the citizens in saving energy: people of a community that have power’s over-production can take benefits in terms of gain by selling the excess energy to neighbourhood instead of power suppliers due to the fees that they have to pay in the latter case. On the other hand, citizens that need additional energy can buy it from sellers in the neighbourhood at favorable prices. In this paper we present an agent-based framework that allows the collection of data about energy consumption in a neighbourhood and the negotiation of the whole produced/consumed energy among the involved parties in order to maximize the profits of the community.},

	abstract = {The problem of generating optimal flight trajectories
for an unmanned aerial vehicle in the presence of no-fly
zones is computationally expensive. It is usually solved offline,
at least for those parts which cannot satisfy real time
constraints. An example is the core paths graph algorithm,
which discretizes the operational flight scenario with a finite
dimensional grid of positions-directions pairs.Aweighted and
oriented graph is then defined, wherein the nodes are the
earlier mentioned grid points and the arcs represent minimum
length trajectories compliant with obstacle avoidance constraints.
This paper investigates the exploitation of two parallel
programming techniques to reduce the lead time of the
core paths graph algorithm. The former employs some parallelization
techniques for multi-core and/or multi-processor
platforms. The latter is targeted to a distributed fleet of unmanned
aerial vehicles.Here the statement of the problemand
preliminary development are discussed. A two-dimensional
scenario is analysed by way of example to show the applicability
and the effectiveness of the approaches.},

	abstract = {The Cloud paradigm has largely been adopted in several different contexts and applied to an incredibly large set of technologies. It is an opportunity for IT users to reduce costs and increase efficiency providing an alternative way of using IT services. It represents both a technology for using computing infrastructures in a more efficient way and a business model for selling computing resources. It gives to small and medium enterprises the possibility of using services and technologies that were prerogative of large ones, by paying only for the resources needed and avoiding upfront investment. The possibility of dynamically acquire and use resources and services on the base of a pay-per-use model, implies incredible flexibility in terms of management, which is otherwise often hard to address. On the other hand, because of this flexibility new problems emerge, which involve the evaluation and monitoring of the quality of the acquired resources and services. This chapter presents a survey on the solutions and technologies proposed by research and open community to face such issues.},

Semantic techniques and full text search are used to support human experts for the analysis and classification of test logs, in order to speedup and improve the diagnosis phase. Moreover, retrieval of tests and requirements, which can be related to the current failure, is supported in order to allow the discovery of available alternatives and solutions for a better and faster investigation of the problem.},

Intelligent agents have to react to their perceptions and take decision according to their knowledge and their preferences. In complex applications agents have to take into account different criteria, whose relevance and priority depend on their preferences and desires. So the problem is how to measure the importance of these criteria and how to combine these values in order to evaluate and choose among the available decisions. In this paper a multi-criteria decision-aid has been used to model a general solution for this kind of problems. Hence the model is specialized in three different application scenarios to implement a multi agents software solution.},

	abstract = {The Cloud Computing paradigm has been an incredible success in the last few years. It is based on the idea of delegate to the Cloud provider every kind of resources, and let the users access them in a self-service fashion. The Cloud paradigm has largely been adopted in several different contexts and applied to an incredibly large set of technologies. It is an opportunity for IT users to reduce costs and increase efficiency providing an alternative way of using IT services. It represents both a technology for using computing infrastructures in a more efficient way and a business model for selling computing resources. It gives to small and medium enterprises the possibility of using services and technologies that were prerogative of large ones, by paying only for the resources needed and avoiding upfront investment. The possibility of dynamically acquire and use resources and services on the base of a pay-per-use model, implies incredible flexibility in terms of management, which is otherwise often hard to address. On the other hand, because of this flexibility new problems emerge, which involve the evaluation and monitoring of the quality of the acquired resources and services as well as threats that can compromise performance and availability of services provided to final users. This chapter describes some open challenges to performance evaluation and provisioning in Cloud, and presents a survey on the solutions and technologies proposed by research and open community to face such issues.},

	journal = {WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT},
	volume = {27},
	abstract = {Water Network Partitioning (WNP) represents the application of the "divide and conquer" paradigm to a Smart WAter Network (SWAN) that allows the improved application of techniques for water balance and pressure control. Indeed, these techniques can be applied with greater effectiveness by defining smaller permanent network parts, called District Meter Areas (DMAs), created by the insertion of gate valves and flow meters. The traditional criteria for the design of network DMAs are based on empirical suggestions (number of properties, length of pipes, etc.) and on approaches such as 'trial and error', even if used together with hydraulic simulation software. Nevertheless, these indications and procedures are very difficult to apply to large water supply systems because the insertion of gate valves modifies the original network layout and may considerably worsen the hydraulic performance of the water network. The proposed tool, based on some graph partitioning techniques, commonly applied in distributed computing, and on an original optimisation technique, allows the automatic design of a WNP comparing different possible layouts that are compliant with hydraulic performance. In this paper, the methodology was tested on a real case study using some performance indices to compare different WNPs. The proposed tool was developed in Phyton and integrates graph partitioning, hydraulic simulation techniques and a heuristic optimisation criterion. It allows the definition of DMAs with resulting performance indices that are very similar to the original network layout.},

	journal = {FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS},
	volume = {29},
	abstract = {Today, large-scale distributed Cloud computing infrastructures are often characterized by the fact that
each participating organization, like a company in the free economy scenario, when making its resources
available, will strive for reducing its own cost and for optimizing its own benefit, regardless of the
consequences on the global Cloud’s welfare, in terms of effectiveness and performance losses. The selfish
behavior of all these entities (end-users, Cloud providers, underlying enterprises/data centers), competing
strategically for resources (distributed storage, processing power, bandwidth), motivates the use of game
theory and autonomous agents for effective Multi-User Task Scheduling. Accordingly, we present a
novel uncoordinated fully distributed scheduling scheme for federated cloud organizations, based on
independent, competing, and self-interested job/task execution agents, driven by optimum social welfare
criteria towards a Nash equilibrium solution. The agents’ behavior is also conditioned by marginal costs, to
force some kind of implicit coordination between the (often conflicting) objectives of the various entities
involved in the cloud. Due to its inherent parallel nature, such schema can provide a significantly better
scalability in presence of a large number of tasks and resources involved into the scheduling system.},

	abstract = {This document is an extension of the Practical Guide to Cloud Computing white paper that was delivered by the Cloud Standards Customer Council (CSCC) in October, 2011. The aim of this guide is to provide a practical reference to help enterprise information technology (IT) and business decision makers as they analyze and consider service level agreements (SLA) from different cloud service providers. The paper will give guidance to decision makers on what to expect and what to be aware of as they evaluate SLAs from their cloud computing providers. A checklist of key criteria for evaluating and comparing SLAs from different providers will be included. Additionally, this paper will highlight the role that standards play to improve interoperability and comparability across different cloud providers, and identify areas where future standardization could be effective. SLAs are important to clearly set expectations for service between the cloud consumer (buyer) and the cloud provider (seller). Each cloud entity engaged by the enterprise should have a cloud SLA defined, including: cloud provider, cloud carrier, cloud broker and even cloud auditor. Consideration must also be given to the different models of service delivery: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS)) as each model brings different requirements. This paper focuses primarily on the SLA details between the cloud consumer and cloud provider, and focuses on the requirements that are common across the various service models (emphasis is given to the IaaS service model since SLAs are more advanced in this area). The Practical Guide to Cloud Service Level Agreements contains a set of guidelines and strategies to help decision makers in all major activities related to cloud SLAs.
The section entitled “Current SLA Landscape” explains the dynamics that currently exists between consumers and providers in the SLA space and the impact that company size has on the power to negotiate terms. This section also highlights the nuances of SLA development for different service models.
The section entitled “Guide for Evaluating Cloud Service Levels Agreements” is the heart of the guide. It provides a prescriptive series of steps that cloud consumers should take to evaluate cloud SLAs with the goal of comparing cloud service providers or negotiating terms with a provider. It provides guidance for the business and service level objectives of the SLA, highlighting what to be aware of and how to compare service levels across different cloud providers. This section takes into account the realities of today’s cloud computing ecosystem and postulates how it is likely evolve in the future, including the important role that standards will play to improve interoperability and consistency across providers.},

Even if there are many Cloud Providers, with a rich and various offer of technological solutions, above all at IAAS, however there is neither support of SLA negotiation, nor of SLA management yet. One of the most important issue in such a context is the lack of negotiation interfaces and mechanisms by current providers for dynamic provisioning, which instead only make available a configuration form to submit the request for a specific resource among the available ones. In the following we propose the design of a tool for SLA based dynamic provisioning of Cloud Resources at IAAS, that offer to the user negotiation and brokering facilities by integrating multiple models.

computing (Grid, Cloud, etc.) pose a high threshold for
potential customers. The reason deals with the technical
background and effort that are usually required in order to
successfully access the computing facilities, thus limiting their
massive adoption. By exploiting the features offered by
different distributed paradigms (P2P and Cloud), we propose
here an approach that reverses the role of resource requestors
and resource providers, allowing potential customers to access
the distributed infrastructures in a user-friendly fashion. In
the proposed scenario, the task of retrieving the user’s
submitted jobs and configure accordingly the necessary
resources is in charge of the providers, thus lowering the
threshold required to successfully exploit the computing
facilities. The experimental activities, described in the paper,
validate the hypothesis that a competitive approach, in
distributed scheduling environments, can decrease the
threshold required to access the facilities and lead, if properly
set up, to substantial performance gains},

	abstract = {Cloud Computing has emerged as a model to provide access to large amount
of data and computational resources by using simple interfaces. Computing
is being transformed to a model consisting of services and they are delivered
without regard to where and how services are hosted. The easiness of using and
conguring resources has made this model widespread and several enterprises
now oer Cloud-based services to end users and businesses. Anyway, Cloud
Computing is still an emerging architecture, and new providers with dierent
services rise every month. In addition, it is very hard to nd a single provider
which oers all services needed by end users. For this reason, a way to provide
a common access to Cloud services and to discover and use required services in
Cloud federations is appealing. This is a problem, since dierent Cloud systems
and vendors have dierent ways to describe and invoke their services, to specify
requirements and to communicate. mOSAIC project addresses these problems
by dening a common ontology and it aims to develop an open-source platform
that enables applications to negotiate Cloud services as requested by users.
The main problem in dening the mOSAIC ontology is in the heterogeneity of
terms used by Clouds vendors, and in the number of standards which refer to
Cloud Systems with dierent terminology. In this work the mOSAIC Cloud
Ontology is described. It has been built by analysing Cloud standards and
proposals. The Ontology has been then rened by introducing individuals
from real cloud systems.},

	abstract = {The cloud paradigm appeared on the computing scene in 2005 with the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) [1]. After this date, a large set of related technologies has been developed. In the academic world, and especially in the HPC area, cloud computing is in some way in competition with the GRID model, which offers a middleware based approach. One of the solutions proposed is the integration of the two paradigms, in order to use the enormous potential of the existent computational GRIDs in new ways. One of the most diffused problems on this systems is the choice of the correct programming paradigm: many different approaches exist and it is difficult to define which is the approach that best fit with the cloud paradigm. In this paper we propose the integration of a Cloud on GRID architecture with a mobile agent platform. The architecture we propose offer Virtual clusters with full administrative control to final users, adopting an existent GRID architecture and especially its security infrastructure. The mobile agent platform is able to dynamically add and configure services on the virtual clusters. The experience here presented shows that the mobile agent paradigm well fulfills the dynamic properties of the Cloud paradigm and could be a good choice to simply develop application and services able to dynamically adapt themselves to the virtualized environment},

	abstract = {According to SOA model (Service Oriented Architecture), services can be used or can use other services. Participation is not supported. A service cannot collaborate with other partners being aware of this collaboration. As Grid services are developed according to the SOA model, we investigate how the integration of mobile agent technology in Grid architectures can help to overcome this limitation. Aims of this contribution are: design and development of agent based Globus services. Mobile agents programmers can execute their application on Grid infrastructures. Grid users, on their own, can invoke mobile agents services using standard Web Services technology. Here we define a model of agent-enabled Grid node and describe the architecture we have designed and realized. In particular we implemented some services to manage and monitor mobile agents platforms executing on a Grid node. We support inter-Grid Nodes agent mobility that exploits globus authentication mechanisms. The more general result is the definition of a service model and a framework for developing and deploying Mobile Agents based Grid services. Our framework supports programmers by automatic generation of code that implements, for each new designed service, a proxy between WSRF technology and Mobile Agents one.},

For example a text document can be delivered as audiostream when an user is driving, or when it cannot exploit a content as it is, because he is blind. Different kinds of multimedia fruition allow also to conceive new value added services and new models of interaction with contents. Here we present architecture design, and prototypal implementation, of a framework that can be integrated, transparently, in web applications, to add mobile agents based adaptive delivery.

State-full migration can help to distribute computation where data reside and among new available and less busy machines. However when mobile agent technology is used new kinds of interaction facilities, such as cloning and migration, require execution of agent platforms, which represent an additional software layer that affects system performances. Also underlying hardware architecture can affect agent platform behaviour in an unexpected way. It means that is necessary to predict dynamics of workload distribution and to monitor system utilization in order to design effective load balancing strategies. We propose here a software architecture that, using results of system monitoring, applies a load balancing strategy to maintain in a fixed range threshold performances of a Mobile Agents based application},

Parallelism in such environments is not easy to accomplish due to the heterogeneity of processes, methodologies and tools. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a key factor in the development of an organic modelling and execution methodology in order to build a heterogeneous and distributed environment that supports a system testing. In this paper we propose an adoption of a classical SOA reference architecture in order to address the build of such an environment for safety-critical control systems. Moreover we provide indications on the integration of SOA specific architecture components with existing centralized testing environments providing an example in signalling railway control systems.},

	abstract = {The impossibility of statically determining the behavior of complex systems that interact at runtime with heterogeneous devices and remote entities, may lead to unexpected system failures and performance degradation. Recently, self-adaptive applications have been recognized as viable solutions for dealing with systems where size and complexity increase beyond the ability of humans. However, self-adaptive solutions have been always studied in isolation, only involving single layers of the system (e.g. operative system, middleware, firmware, hardware). In this paper we discuss our novel idea of multi-layers deep adaptability of complex systems. We present an integrated approach for designing and coordinating applications with three-layers of self-adaptation. The solution proposed is based on specialized sense-plan-act control loops that interact each others to monitor both specific parts and also the global behavior of the system. These control loops sense unexpected behaviors that can compromise the system, then diagnose the system layer that needs an adaptation action, and finally act the proper adaptation strategy to overcome the revealed problems without user intervention. We validate the approach with a SOA-based application, the Virtual Tour Guide, designed with three-layers self-adaptive abilities in order to overcome functional/non-functional problems that can derive from the integration of heterogeneous and remote third-party service},

It is based on open standards and common data formats which allow a deep cooperation among Entities and applications and guarantee strong resource sharing. In such context security plays a primary role to control access to data and functionalities offered by distributed services. In this paper we illustrate a policy-based approach to manage security and personalization, in particular we have designed a hybrid infrastructure based on web services in which policy enforcer mechanisms are managed both in a centralized way by the registry server and in a distributed way, i.e. each service implements security mechanisms to authenticate and authorize users. A case study is illustrated showing a distributed architecture for health-care applications.},

Most Java-based systems that support portable parallel and distributed computing either require the programmer to deal with intricate low-level details of Java which can be a tedious, time-consuming and error-prone task, or prevent the programmer from controlling locality of data. In contrast to most existing systems, JavaSymphony - a class library written entirely in Java - allows to control parallelism, load balancing, and locality, at a high level. Objects can be explicitly distributed and migrated based on virtual architectures which impose a virtual hierarchy on a distributed/parallel system of physical computing nodes. The concept of blocking/nonblocking remote method invocation is used to exchange data among distributed objects and to process work by remote objects. In this paper we evaluate the JavaSymphony programming API for a variety, of distributed/parallel algorithms which comprises backtracking, N-body, encryption/decryption algorithms and asynchronous nested optimization algorithms. Performance results are presented for both homogeneous and heterogeneous cluster architectures. Moreover we compare JavaSymphony with an alternative well-known semi-automatic system.},
